  Produce a Rating Pitch Deck for a company using Moody's GenAI MCP tools, delivered as an
  editable PowerPoint (.pptx) saved to disk. Use this skill whenever the user asks to create
  a rating pitch, rating pitch deck, credit pitch, rating presentation, or rating pitch
  report. Also trigger when they ask for a comprehensive credit overview combining sector
  analysis, company financials, SWOT, peer comparison, and ESG into a single deck or
  presentation. Trigger even if they just name a company and say "pitch deck", "rating deck",
  or "credit deck".

# Rating Pitch Skill

Generates a Moody's Rating Pitch Deck as an editable PowerPoint (.pptx) from a single MCP
data pass. The Python builder (`scripts/build_pptx.py`) opens the official Moody's Corp 2026
PowerPoint template, removes its demo slides, and populates the template's built-in layouts
(Cover, Agenda, Dividers, 1/2/3-column content, Back Cover, Disclaimer) with the resolved
payload data. The builder produces native, editable PowerPoint charts and tables end-to-end —
no HTML preview, no in-chat artifact.

> ## ⚠️ CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE OUTPUT CONTRACT
>
> Every run of this skill MUST produce an editable `.pptx`. Specifically:
>
> - The skill **MUST** save the resolved `payload.json` to
>   `~/Desktop/rating-pitch/<company>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/` and run `scripts/build_pptx.py`
>   against it to produce the editable `rating_pitch.pptx` alongside it.
> - The LLM **MUST NOT** stream the deck content as inline HTML, Markdown, JSON dumps, or
>   any other in-chat artifact in lieu of building the `.pptx`. The `.pptx` itself is the
>   deliverable.
> - The final assistant message **MUST** point the user at the full path to the generated
>   `rating_pitch.pptx` so they can open it.
> - If data gathering fails partially, still build the `.pptx` from the partial payload
>   using `"--"` placeholders for missing values — never skip the build.
>
> Treat any other output shape as a hard failure of the skill.

## Required MCP server

`Moodys MCP server` — tools used: `findEntity`, `getEntityPeers`, `getEntityRatings`,
`getEntityCreditOpinion` (sections: Profile, Summary, RatingOutlook,
FactorsLeadingToUpgrade, FactorsLeadingToDowngrade, CreditStrengths, CreditChallenges,
ESGConsiderations, KeyIndicatorsTable, ScorecardTable), `getEntityFinancials`,
`getEntityEsg`, `getEntitySectorOutlook`, `searchEntityEarningsCall`,
`searchEntityDocuments`, `searchNews`

Web research is also required via searchNews or general web search tools.

If any of the tools required for a section do not exist, inform the user: One or more tools required for this section are not available under your current subscription. Unlock more of the expert insights, data, and analytics you trust. Get Link:https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/capabilities/gen-ai/ai-ready-data.html with us to learn more.


## Bundled files

- `scripts/build_pptx.py` — the deck builder. Takes a JSON payload and emits a `.pptx`.
- `scripts/requirements.txt` — Python dependencies (`python-pptx`). Unchanged.
- `assets/Moody_Corp_Template.pptx` — official Moody's 2026 Corp PowerPoint template.
  The builder opens this file, clears its demo slides, and populates its layouts.
  **Do not modify.**
- `assets/sample_payload.json` — reference payload showing every field populated. Read this
  if you're ever unsure what a field should look like.

## Parameters the user should provide

- **Company Name** (required)
- **Sector** (required — e.g., "Aerospace/Defense", "Consumer Products"). Infer it from
  the company if the user doesn't say.
- **Number of peers** (optional, default 6)
- **Currency** (optional, default USD)

---

## Step 1 — Resolve the target company

Call `findEntity` with the company name. Store the canonical entity name and ID.

## Step 2 — Gather ALL data in parallel

Fire the following in a **single parallel batch**. Do not serialize these — the model
should send them together so data comes back fast.

### Target company data

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `getEntityCreditOpinion` (sections: Profile, Summary, RatingOutlook, FactorsLeadingToUpgrade, FactorsLeadingToDowngrade, CreditStrengths, CreditChallenges, ESGConsiderations, KeyIndicatorsTable, ScorecardTable) | Credit opinion sections for financial analysis, SWOT, scorecard |
| `getEntityRatings` | Current rating + last 5 rating actions for history chart |
| `getEntityEsg` | ESG scores |
| `getEntitySectorOutlook` | Sector overview and outlook |
| `getEntityPeers` (N peers) | Peer set |
| `searchEntityEarningsCall` (keywords: outlook, guidance, forecast, strategy) | Strategic updates / forward-looking |
| `searchEntityDocuments` (annual/quarterly reports) | Revenue segments, geography |
| `searchNews` | M&A, leadership, external trends |

### Peer data (for each peer)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `findEntity` | Resolve canonical name |
| `getEntityRatings` | Peer rating + outlook |
| `getEntityCreditOpinion` (sections: Profile, KeyIndicatorsTable, ScorecardTable) | Financials + scorecard |
| `getEntityFinancials` (prompt: `"annual revenue, EBITDA, EBIT margin, debt/EBITDA, RCF/net debt, most recent year-end only"`, filterCriteria: `{excludeInterimData: true}`) | Most recent full-year financials for peer charts |
| `getEntityEsg` | Peer ESG scores |

**Period-selection rule (applies to target company and every peer):**
When `getEntityFinancials` returns multiple annual periods, always use the
**most recent year-end period available** — i.e. the column with the highest
calendar or fiscal year. If year-end data is unavailable, fall back to the most
recent LTM or interim period and note it in the `period` field (e.g. `"LTM Mar 2025"`).
Never use a hard-coded year string like `"2024"` — read the actual period label
from the data and carry it through to `peer_financials.rows[].period` and
`peer_profitability_charts` / `peer_debt_charts` entries.

---

## Step 3 — Synthesize the sections

Build a single in-memory **resolved payload** that matches the JSON shape in the **Payload
schema** section below (a reference copy lives at `assets/sample_payload.json`). This
payload drives the `.pptx` build (Step 4) — fill it completely before moving on.

Content rules for each section:

> **`commentary` type rule — applies to every section without exception:**
> All `commentary` fields in the payload MUST be a **JSON array of strings** — never a
> bare string. A bare string passed to the `.pptx` builder is iterated character-by-character,
> producing one bullet per character (the `• C \n • o \n • m` bug). Always write:
> `"commentary": ["Sentence one.", "Sentence two."]` — even for a single sentence.

### Part 1 — Sector Analysis

- **sector_overview** — three 3-bullet lists (overview / watchlist / takeaways). Keep
  bullets punchy, ≤25 words each.
- **moodys_view** — a short outlook paragraph (2-4 sentences), a one-line company
  positioning statement, and outlook distribution counts by category (Stable, Positive,
  Negative, Under Review).
- **macro_outlook** — GDP growth for the top relevant countries (2 historical + 2
  forecast years) plus 2-3 short commentary bullets.
- **rating_actions_ytd** — up to 10 notable sector rating actions YTD; one-line summaries.

### Part 2 — Company Credit Overview

- **financial_analysis** — 5-6 commentary bullets (revenue, margin, leverage, cash flow,
  liquidity, rating rationale). Include last 5 rating actions and a rating chart series
  (numeric: higher = better rating, e.g., Aaa=21, Baa3=10, Caa1=4).
  **`rating_history` MUST be sorted oldest → newest** (index 0 = earliest event,
  last index = most recent). `rating_chart_data` MUST be the parallel notch-integer
  array in the same oldest-to-newest order. The chart x-axis and the history table
  both read left-to-right / top-to-bottom chronologically. `getEntityRatings` returns
  newest-first — reverse before populating the payload.
- **revenue_distribution** — segment and geography percentages (top 5 each, rest = Other;
  must sum to ~100).
- **swot** — 3 items per quadrant, 15-25 words each.
- **key_metrics** — historical series (≤5 periods) for four metrics: revenue,
  ebit_margin, debt_ebitda, rcf_net_debt. Arrays must match the `periods` array length.
  Use `null` (not omission) for missing points.
- **strategic_updates** — `recent` (3-5) and `forward` (3-5, strictly future-looking).
- **news_mna** / **external_trends** — structured list form:
  `[{"category": "...", "items": ["...", "..."]}]`. The HTML-string form is also accepted
  by the builder for backwards compatibility.

### Part 3 — Company Positioning vs. Peers

- **peer_summary** — row per company (target first), plus 2-3 commentary bullets.
- **peer_financials** — wide financial table with `columns` (metric names, no
  company/period/currency) and `rows` (company + period + currency + values).
  Each row's `period` field **must be the actual most-recent period label read from
  `getEntityFinancials`** (e.g. `"FY2025"`, `"FY2024"`, `"LTM Mar 2025"`). Never
  default all rows to the same hard-coded year. Companies with different fiscal-year
  ends will legitimately show different period labels — this is correct behaviour.
- **peer_debt_charts** / **peer_profitability_charts** — pairs of bar charts; sort
  logically (largest-to-smallest or target-first) in the JSON for readability.
  Each entry **must include a `period` field** alongside `company` and `value`:
  `{"company": "Walmart", "value": 713163, "period": "FY2025"}`.
  The `period` is used as a sub-label on the bar. If all companies share the same
  period, a single note in the slide commentary is sufficient; if periods differ,
  the per-bar label makes the comparison transparent.
- **peer_scatter** — two scatter series (`margin_vs_leverage`, `fcf_vs_rcf`), each a list
  of `{company, x, y}` points. Drop extreme outliers that would distort the axes.
- **scorecard** — `factors` (row labels, including group headers), `is_header` boolean
  flags per row, `companies` (column headers), and `values` as a 3D array: outer = rows,
  middle = columns, inner = `[measure, score]` or `[]` for header rows.
- **esg_analysis** — table of CIS/E/S/G scores plus 3-5 commentary bullets.

Target first in every peer table.

## Step 4 — Build the editable .pptx

**Default output location: always save runs to the user's Desktop** so they're easy to
find. Use `~/Desktop/rating-pitch/<company>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/` as the `<output-dir>`.
Only use a different path if the user explicitly asks for one.

1. Save your resolved payload to `<output-dir>/payload.json`.
2. Ensure `python-pptx` is available. If the user doesn't have it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r <skill-dir>/scripts/requirements.txt
   ```
   or simply `pip install python-pptx` if their environment allows it.
3. Run the builder:
   ```bash
   python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/build_pptx.py <output-dir>/payload.json <output-dir>/rating_pitch.pptx
   ```
4. Open the deck: `open <output-dir>/rating_pitch.pptx`
5. The final assistant message gives the full `<output-dir>/rating_pitch.pptx` path so the
   user can open the editable deck.

If any section data is missing, still include the section in the payload (empty arrays
are fine) — the builder handles empties gracefully and the deck will stay well-formed.

## Payload schema

> ⚠️ **`rating_chart_data` constraint:** This array MUST have the same length as
> `rating_history`. Index `i` must match: `rating_history[i] ↔ rating_chart_data[i]`.
> Both arrays must be sorted **oldest → newest**.

10. SWOT (2×2)
11. Key Financial Metrics (four bar charts)
12. Strategic Updates (2 columns)
13. News, M&A & Leadership

19. Peer Comparison — Profitability (two horizontal bar charts)
20. Peer Scatter Plots (two scatters)
21. Scorecard Comparison (multi-column factor table)
22. ESG Analysis (table + commentary)
23. Sources (appendix)

The builder's brand palette: `NAVY=#0A1264`, `BRIGHT=#005EFF`, `MID=#35397E`,
`PURPLE=#7677A7`, `PALE=#A2A2C4`, `VERY_PALE=#CFD0E1`, `PINK=#D9017A`, `TEAL=#4FB3AE`,
`GOLD=#C4A51A`, `LIGHT_GRAY=#D7D8D7`. Outlook pie palette (case-insensitive):
`Stable → LIGHT_GRAY`, `Positive → TEAL`, `Negative → GOLD`, `Under Review → BRIGHT`.

## Tips

- Run ALL data-gathering tool calls in a single parallel batch.
- Keep the target company first in every peer table — the `.pptx` and the
  commentary all assume this ordering.
- `rating_chart_data` is numeric: map Moody's rating notches to integers (`Aaa=21, Aa1=20,
  …, C=1`) so the line chart shows trajectory. Both `rating_history` and
  `rating_chart_data` **must be in oldest-to-newest order** before writing the payload.
  `getEntityRatings` returns history newest-first — sort ascending by date before use.
- Pie percentages must sum to 100 — bucket small categories into "Other".
- `key_metrics` arrays must match `periods` length. Use `null` for missing points.
- Scorecard header rows use `is_header=true` and `values[row] = [[], [], ...]` (empty
  per-company entries). The builder turns these into merged header rows in the `.pptx`.
- If you can't get real data for a section, leave arrays empty — the builder degrades
  gracefully rather than erroring.
- Dates in the deck are just strings; format however reads best (e.g., "Nov 20, 2025").
- The `<output-dir>` name should be lower-cased and hyphen-joined (e.g.
  `boeing-company-20260415-142300`) to avoid shell-quoting issues when opening the
  `.pptx`.
- Revenue value labels must use comma-separated thousands with zero decimal places
  (`#,##0`). Use `"#,##0"` as the `y_format` argument in `add_bar_chart` for the `.pptx`.
- **Never copy `period` values from `sample_payload.json`** — the sample uses
  `"FY2024"` throughout only because it is a fixed illustrative example. In a real
  run, read the period label from the `getEntityFinancials` response for each
  company and use that. A company reporting in 2025 must show `"FY2025"`, not
  `"FY2024"`. Anchoring on the sample year is a silent data-accuracy bug.
