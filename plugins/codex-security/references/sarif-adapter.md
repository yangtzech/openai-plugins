# SARIF Adapter

SARIF is a deterministic export, not the Codex Security source of truth.

The adapter:

- reads the sealed semantic bundle without mutating its manifest
- stores SARIF separately from the canonical seal
- emits SARIF 2.1.0
- uses stable `ruleId` values
- keeps rule descriptors stable across scans
- emits repository-relative POSIX paths
- uses one root-control location for GitHub annotation when available and keeps remaining evidence locations under `relatedLocations`
- preserves the semantic fingerprint under `codexSecurity/v1`
- emits GitHub's source-line `primaryLocationLineHash` when it can safely hash a bounded regular non-symlink source file inside the available source root
- maps categorical severity to SARIF `level`

Lifecycle, rich validation evidence, attack-path context, and coverage are lossy or omitted in SARIF. Preserve them in semantic JSON.

Automatic SARIF export during finalization is best-effort so projection errors cannot invalidate a canonical seal. Use the strict adapter entry point when a consumer requires SARIF and should surface export errors.
